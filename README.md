## 🧠 Project Goals

* 📊 Analyze historical Brent oil price trends.
* 🔍 Detect significant **change points** in the time series using statistical methods.
* 📈 Visualize oil price shifts and explore correlations with geopolitical or economic events.
* 🧪 Lay the foundation for predictive modeling in future tasks.

---

## 📦 Key Features

* ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (\~9,000+ rows).
* ✅ Robust Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* ✅ Change point detection using libraries like `ruptures`, `statsmodels`, or `scipy`.
* ✅ Modular structure for easy extension (backend/frontend ready).
* ✅ Jupyter Notebooks for transparency and interpretability.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brent-oil-change-point-analysis.git
   cd brent-oil-change-point-analysis
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Explore the Notebooks**

   * Run the notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder:

     * `01_task1_foundation.ipynb`: Data loading and cleaning.
     * `task2_analysis.ipynb`: Time series and change point analysis.

5. *(Optional)* Run backend or frontend components:

   * Backend: `cd backend/` → run API server (e.g., FastAPI)
   * Frontend: `cd frontend/` → run app (e.g., Streamlit or React)
